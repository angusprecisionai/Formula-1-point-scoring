Welcome to the repo! 
There is some basic python code to see how the F1 leaderboard would look if the point system was different.

Run the main.py, if you wish to update the point system -> Change the constant arrays in the point_system.py file.
Update the main.py to use the array you wish for GP and sprint.
Fastest lap logic is within the main.

This is update to date as of the 2024 Belgium GP. I will not be maintaining this, please submit a PR if you wish to update the results.
